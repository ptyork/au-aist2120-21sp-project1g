# Game board is a "dictionary" of strings.
# Keys will be to board "coordinates" (col+row...e.g., "C2").
# Values will be '', 'w' or 'b'.
game_board = {}

# Write code to initialize the dictionary here
# (e.g., game_board['A1'] = .......)

# write a function that shows the board according to the instructions
def display_board():
    # do your thing here
    return


# write a function returns the COUNT of pieces for the given color
# that can still move
def moves_remaining(color):
    # do your thing here
    return 0  # change this to return the actual count


# Add any additional functions if you want them below here



# And finally, do your actual gameplay (the code that runs
# when you execute your script) below here...while True:
# is likely the right place to begin.
